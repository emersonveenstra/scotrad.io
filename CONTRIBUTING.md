We follow standard GitHub contributing procedures. To submit a patch:

* Fork the repo to your account
* Clone your forked repo
* Checkout a new branch, and work on that branch for the patch
* When you are done, push the branch to your fork and submit a pull request with that branch
* Someone will comment with feedback, and hopefully get your patch merged in
* If you need to change the original patch, pushing to the same branch will update the PR
