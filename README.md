==========

I am no longer involved with Scot Radio, and so will no longer be maintaining
this app. This is the backup of the full Node app, for whoever picks this up
after me. The repo will remain open, and I will still be available for questions
if necessary. The master branch will house the static files that the current
site is running off of, because the advanced functionality I had planned was
never implemented fully or correctly, so there was no need for a full app.

If anyone from Scot Radio wants to pick this up (or anyone else!), email me or
open an issue and I will add you to the group.
