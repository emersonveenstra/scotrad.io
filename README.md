==========

I am no longer involved with Scot Radio, and so I will not be maintaining this
any more. This branch is now a static site for ease of hosting. The node-version
branch contains all the work I did on some advanced functionality that was never
completed, but will be a good starting point for anyone who wants to continue
this.

If you want to pick this up, please email me or open an issue and I will add you
to the group.
